Crystal Collector Game

A simple browser game in which the goal each round is to reach the target number, which is randomized each round. The crystal buttons each have a hidden value, which is randomized each round. The user must click the crystals to add to their score until it matches the target number. If the user's score exceeds that of the target number, they lose the round. 

The game has a lite fantasy theme.
